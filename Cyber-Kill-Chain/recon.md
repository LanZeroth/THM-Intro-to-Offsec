# Reconnaissance

**Reconnaissance** is the process of discovering and collecting information on a system or victim. It represents the planning phase for adversaries, where they gather intelligence to prepare for further stages of an attack.

## OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
OSINT involves collecting publicly available information about a target to help the attacker in the early stages of the attack. This could include company size, employee details, email addresses, phone numbers, and more, which are essential in determining the best target.

You can find more about OSINT in this Varonis article, "What is OSINT?"

## Attacker's Perspective

Imagine a malicious attacker, "Megatron," planning a sophisticated attack. Before he can proceed with the attack, he must first complete the reconnaissance phase. In this phase, "Megatron" will need to conduct OSINT using various tools and techniques to gather relevant information about the target.

### Email Harvesting
**Email harvesting** is the process of collecting email addresses from public, paid, or free services. Attackers use these emails for phishing attacks, which steal sensitive information like login credentials and credit card numbers. 

### Tools for Reconnaissance

- **theHarvester**: Gathers emails, names, subdomains, IPs, and URLs from multiple public data sources.
- **Hunter.io**: Allows attackers to obtain contact information associated with a domain.
- **OSINT Framework**: A web-based interface that provides a collection of OSINT tools based on different categories.

Attackers may also use social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to gather additional information about a target.
