# My TryHackMe Journey

Welcome to my TryHackMe journey! ðŸš€

## About This Journey
This repository documents my progress, experiences, and learnings as I navigate through various rooms and challenges on TryHackMe, a platform dedicated to helping users learn and practice cybersecurity skills. My goal is to build a strong foundation in penetration testing, ethical hacking, and overall cybersecurity concepts.

## Introduction
I began my TryHackMe journey to dive deep into the world of cybersecurity and enhance my technical skills. This repository serves as a journal of my experiences, the knowledge I've gained, and the challenges I've overcome.

## Completed Rooms
Here are some of the rooms I've completed so far:

1. **[Pentesting Fundamentals](https://www.tryhackme.com/r/room/pentestingfundamentals)**
   - **Description**: An introduction to penetration testing covering reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and reporting.
   - **Highlights**: Learned to use tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Nikto. Gained practical experience in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.

2. (List additional rooms here)

## Skills Acquired
Throughout my TryHackMe journey, I have developed and honed the following skills:
- **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information through active and passive methods.
- **Scanning & Enumeration**: Identifying live hosts, open ports, and services.
- **Exploitation**: Using known vulnerabilities to gain access to systems.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Maintaining access, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.
- **Reporting**: Documenting findings and providing actionable security recommendations.

## Tools Used
I've become proficient in using a variety of cybersecurity tools, including but not limited to:
- **Nmap**: For network discovery and security auditing.
- **Metasploit**: For penetration testing and exploitation.
- **Nikto**: For web server vulnerability scanning.
- **John the Ripper**: For password cracking.
- **Hydra**: For brute force attacks on login forms.

## Future Goals
My journey is far from over! Here are some of my future goals:
- Complete advanced rooms on TryHackMe.
- Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.
- Obtain cybersecurity certifications (e.g., CompTIA Security+, OSCP).
- Continuously improve my skills and stay updated with the latest cybersecurity trends.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank TryHackMe for providing an amazing platform to learn and practice cybersecurity skills. Special thanks to the cybersecurity community for the endless resources, support, and motivation.
