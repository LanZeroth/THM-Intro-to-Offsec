## Introduction
I began my TryHackMe journey to dive deep into the world of cybersecurity and enhance my technical skills. This repository serves as a journal of my experiences, the knowledge I've gained, and the challenges I've overcome.

## Completed Rooms
Here are some of the rooms I've completed so far:

1. **[Pentesting Fundamentals](https://www.tryhackme.com/r/room/pentestingfundamentals)**
   - **Description**: An introduction to penetration testing covering reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and reporting.
   - **Highlights**: Learned to use tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Nikto. Gained practical experience in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.

2.Careers in Cyber
Learn about the different careers in cyber security.

3.Intro to Defensive Security
Introducing defensive security and related topics, such as threat intelligence, SOC, DFIR, and SIEM.

4.Web Application Security
Learn about web applications and explore some of their common security issues.

<!--## Skills Acquired
Throughout my TryHackMe journey, I have developed and honed the following skills:
- **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information through active and passive methods.
- **Scanning & Enumeration**: Identifying live hosts, open ports, and services.
- **Exploitation**: Using known vulnerabilities to gain access to systems.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Maintaining access, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.
- **Reporting**: Documenting findings and providing actionable security recommendations.-->

<!--## Tools Used
I've become proficient in using a variety of cybersecurity tools, including but not limited to:
- **Nmap**: For network discovery and security auditing.
- **Metasploit**: For penetration testing and exploitation.
- **Nikto**: For web server vulnerability scanning.
- **John the Ripper**: For password cracking.
- **Hydra**: For brute force attacks on login forms.-->

## Future Goals
My journey is far from over! Here are some of my future goals:
- Complete advanced rooms on TryHackMe.
- Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.
- Obtain cybersecurity certifications (e.g., CompTIA Security+, OSCP).
- Continuously improve my skills and stay updated with the latest cybersecurity trends.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank TryHackMe for providing an amazing platform to learn and practice cybersecurity skills. Special thanks to the cybersecurity community for the endless resources, support, and motivation.
