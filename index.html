    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>I began my TryHackMe journey to dive deep into the world of cybersecurity and enhance my technical skills. This repository serves as a journal of my experiences, the knowledge I've gained, and the challenges I've overcome.</p>
    
    <h2 id="completed-rooms">Completed Rooms</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the rooms I've completed so far:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.tryhackme.com/r/room/pentestingfundamentals">Pentesting Fundamentals</a></strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> An introduction to penetration testing covering reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and reporting.</li>
                <li><strong>Highlights:</strong> Learned to use tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Nikto. Gained practical experience in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <!-- List additional rooms here -->
    </ul>
